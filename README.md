# Custom-Unity-Library
Open source extension library for Unity 5.  To use, copy the Custom Unity Library folder into your Assets folder in Unity.  The Under Development folder has some useable code, but it is not reliable.  In the Custom Unity Library folder, either the 2D or 3D folder can be (optionally) removed, depending on your project.
