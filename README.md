# Custom-Unity-Library
Open source extension library for Unity 5.  To use, copy the Custom Unity Library folder (inside the Assets folder) into your Assets folder in Unity.  The Under Development folder has some useable code, but it is not reliable.  The Demo and Gizmos folders contain common modules, and can be altered for your own purposes.
