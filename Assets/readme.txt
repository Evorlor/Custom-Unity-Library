There are four types of scripts in this project.  The 2D scripts are only applicable to 2D games, and the 3D scripts are only applicable to 3D games.  The Generic scripts are applicable to games of all types, and should be included alongside either the 2D folder or 3D folder.  The Under Development folder has scripts which are currently unreliable or incomplete, and should only be used as reference.
